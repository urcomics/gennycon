        <h1>Tabling Information</h1>
        <h2>Interested in tabling at Genny Con? Here are some things to know:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>We do not charge a tabling fee or any other fees.</strong> It's completely free to participate! Likewise, we will not provide reimbursement or compensation for any travel or other related expenses.</li>
            <li><strong>Parking is free</strong> on weekends at the University.</li>
            <li>Our location will be at Hirst Lounge at the U of R River Campus (University of Rochester, Wilson Commons, 201, Rochester, NY 14627)</li>
            <li>We have the location reserved for <strong>Saturday, October 25th</strong> (if the situation changes, we will let you know in July!). The expo’s duration will be from <strong>12:00 PM to 4:00 PM</strong>, though please plan to arrive at 11:00 AM to set up your booth. You do not have to be there the entire time, though we do request at least 3 hours of availability.</li>
            <li>We give our participants a lot of freedom with what they choose to do with their booths. You can sell comics or other merchandise. You can simply present your work or do an activity. It's up to you! If you do choose to sell items, please be sure to bring a card reader as most students don't carry cash.</li>
            <li>Tables are 6ft long, though we may ask you to share a table.</li>
            <li>While the venue is indoors, the walls are glass. It might be sunny, so you may want to bring an umbrella!</li>
            <li>Don't know if you can table yet? Don't worry— the deadline for signing up is October 13th (a Monday).</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="btn"><a href="https://forms.gle/CvL1asJ9higptFJq8" target="_blank">Sign up to table!</a></div>

        <h2>I signed up. What's next?</h2>
        <p>Thanks for your interest! We will reach out for logistics and arrival timeslots in mid-September. The parking will be a short walking distance away from the venue, and we will help you bring your items over. If you find that you cannot make it, please let us know as soon as possible using our email or the contact form.</p>
